# TauStudy

Code written at the start of tau studies performed for ewkino as a learning experience.

#Efficiency
Contains (currently overcomplicated) code to look at the ROC curves obtained with the different tau ID algorithms and compare them. Also looks at efficiency and misid as function of pt and eta

#Significance
Calculate the significance obtained with the different WP of the Old MVA in order to decide which one fits best what we want to accomplish

#FakeRate
Contains code to calculate the Fake rate of taus in a control region of Z to ll+tau and performs closure tests

#Skimmer
Skim tuples...

#ReproduceAN17_094
Draw plots of Mll and other variables to compare to the tau POG AN as a test
